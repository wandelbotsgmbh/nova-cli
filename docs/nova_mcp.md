## nova mcp

EXPERIMENTAL: Start an MCP server

### Synopsis

EXPERIMENTAL: Start an MCP server based on the NOVA API of the configured host.

You can configure the host using 'nova config set host <host>'.
The local running server will proxy all requests from the LLM to the configured host.

The configuration depends on the AI Coding Assistent of your choice.
For example if using Cursor (https://www.cursor.com/) it looks like this:
'
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nova": {
      "command": "nova",
      "args": [
        "mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
'

To stop the server, use Ctrl+C.


```
nova mcp [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for mcp
```

## nova app install

Installs an app to Wandelbots Nova

### Synopsis

Installs an app to Wandelbots Nova.
This command will install the app depending on the provided source.

For everything which is no app manifest it is expected that a dockerfile and a .nova file is present in the provided source.
In this case, the command is a shortcut for building the docker image, pushing it to the registry 
and installing it to the Nova cell via the nova api and the provided spec within the .nova file.

If the source is an app manifest according to the spec (http://host/api/v1/ui/#/operations/addApp), this will be installed directly, 
without rebuilding and pushing the image.

In any case, if an app already is installed under that name, it will be updated.


```
nova app install [source] [flags]
```

### Examples

```

	# install from the current directory (.nova and Dockerfile must be present)
	nova app install
	
	# install from the current directory (.nova and Dockerfile must be present)
	nova app install .

	# install from the specified directory (.nova and Dockerfile must be present)

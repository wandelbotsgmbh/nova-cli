## nova completion zsh

Generate the autocompletion script for zsh

### Synopsis

Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

	echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

To load completions in your current shell session:

	source <(nova completion zsh)

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

#### Linux:

	nova completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_nova"

#### macOS:

	nova completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_nova

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.


```
nova completion zsh [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help              help for zsh
      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions
```

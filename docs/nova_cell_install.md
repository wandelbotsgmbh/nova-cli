## nova cell install

Install a cell from source

### Synopsis

Installs cell configurations from a given source.

This command will install the cell depending on the provided source, where source can be either a file or a url.
The content can be either in json or yaml format and should comply with the cell configuration specification (see 'http://host/api/v1/ui/#/operations/updateCell').

If the cell already exists, the configuration will be updated according to the provided specification.

NOTE: When executing this command, the CLI configuration will be updated with the cell name from the provided file.
This is the equivalent of running 'nova config set cellname <name>' with the cell name from the given file.

# Nova CLI

The swiss army knife for interacting with [Wandelbots NOVA](https://www.wandelbots.com/).

## Install

### MacOS/Linux

Installation with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```bash
brew install wandelbotsgmbh/wandelbots/nova

# enable autocompletion for zsh (has to be done only once)
echo 'source <(nova completion zsh)' >> ~/.zshrc
```

**Note** Our binaries are not signed yet, thus MacOS will block the first execution.
To fix this, go to `Settings` -> `Privacy & Security` and click `Open Anyway`

### Windows

**Note** The certificate is currently self-signed and might need to be added manually to your computer.
To do so, please download the [source.msix](https://wandelbotsgmbh.github.io/winget-pkgs/) and follow [these instructions](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/install-test-certificate-from-msix.html) to add the certificate.

```bat
winget source add --name wandelbots --arg https://wandelbotsgmbh.github.io/winget-pkgs

winget install NovaCLI
```
